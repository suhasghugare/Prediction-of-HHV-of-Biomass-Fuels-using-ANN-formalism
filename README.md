# Prediction-of-HHV-of-Biomass-Fuels-using-ANN-formalism
This research work involved development of AI-based Multi-Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) model for the prediction of HHV of Biomass Fuels from their Proximate Analysis composition. 

After a statistical analysis of a large dataset of biomass fuels, it is observed that HHV and the components of the proximate analysis are not dependent linearly. So the previously available Linear Models in the literature predicted the biomass HHVs with low prediction performances. <b>MLP</b> models, being inherently non-linear by nature are found to <b>learn the Non-Linear correlations</b> relating the inputs to the outputs quite well, thus resulting in much better prediction performances as compared to the linear regression-based models. This uses Python based AI-Library to build and train the MLP model. 

Originally this was done in <b>Rapidminer</b>—a GUI based data-mining platform. The developed MLP model predicts the fuel HHVs quiet well.
